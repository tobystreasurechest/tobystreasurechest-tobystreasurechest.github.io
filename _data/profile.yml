    Hi! I am Chenxi Ruan, a final-year undergraduate student majoring in software engineering and business administration at 
    South China University of Technology. Meanwhile, I am now working as a research assistant in the <a href="https://hkust-cival.com/" target="_blank" color: palevioletred>HKUST-CIVAL</a>, supervised 
    by <a href="https://zeng-wei.com/" target="_blank" color: palevioletred>Prof. Wei Zeng</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   My research focuses on Dataset Bias Detection and Modeling, as well as Dataset Visualization and Comparison. 
   I investigate methods to detect and model biases within datasets, focusing on training models to identify subtle 
   differences and reveal unique semantic traits or hidden biases inherent to each dataset. Additionally, I develop 
   visualization techniques to make these insights more interpretable, allowing for clearer comparisons across datasets.
